<ol>
<li>
Ray tracing is using mirrors instead of Lenses to magnify or reduce an image. 
	 This works with reflection as a theory

<li>
Spherical Lenses : This works with Refraction.
	 The reason why lenses are able to maginify is because light travels faster in AIR but in glass they travel slower. When they travel slower, they tend to bend towards the normal.
	 <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Convex"></span><strong id="Convex">Convex</strong> : in a convex mirror has a convex surface, the parallel rays converge towards one another. They are called "converging" rays
	 <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Concave"></span><strong id="Concave">Concave</strong> : in a concave mirror has a concave surface, the parallel rays converge towards one another. They are called "diverging" rays

</ol>

<p>
Then the light emerges from the convex lens, the light moves from slow medium to a fast medium. Here it bends away from the normal
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Lenses are curved on both sides, hence they are either bi-convex or bi-concave

<li>
However mirrors are curved only on one side, and the other side is flat and straight.

<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Focal point"></span><strong id="Focal point">Focal point</strong> : The point where the rays converge from the convex lens

<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Focal Length(f)"></span><strong id="Focal Length(f)">Focal Length(f)</strong> : The distance between the lens to the focal point. The focal point is the same for a given lens

<li>
A lens has 2 focal points, one before and one after the lens

<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Thin lens"></span><strong id="Thin lens">Thin lens</strong> : Thin lenses are those whose thickness are lesser than the focal length

<li>
To differentiate between the converging and diverging lens, the <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-f"></span><strong id="f">f</strong> is <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-positive"></span><strong id="positive">positive</strong> for converging and <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-negative"></span><strong id="negative">negative</strong> for diverging lens

<li>
Rules of a converging lens*

<ul>
<li>
Rule 1: Incoming parallel rays are deflected through the focal point

<li>
Rule 2: Rays passing through the center of the lens are undeflected. They continue to travel straight without being bent

<li>
Rule 3: Rays passing through the focal point(entry focal point) are deflected to exit parallel rays

</ul>
<li>
For converging lenses, the image is <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-real"></span><strong id="real">real</strong> and <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-inverted"></span><strong id="inverted">inverted</strong>. The Size of the image is relative to the position of the object to the focal point. 

<li>
If the object is very close to the lens (even lesser than the focal length), then the rays passing through the lens are diverging and will never intersect on the other side of the lens

<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Diverging lens"></span><strong id="Diverging lens">Diverging lens</strong>:

<ol>
<li>
In diverging lens, parallel rays are deflected such that when extended backwards, they seem to appear to have come from the focal point.

<li>
Just like the converging lens, the rays that pass through the center, pass without any deflection

<li>
Rays that if extended would pass through the focal point on the other side, would be deflected parallel to the axis

<li>
Image is <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Virtual"></span><strong id="Virtual">Virtual</strong>, <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-reduced"></span><strong id="reduced">reduced</strong>, and <span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Right side up"></span><strong id="Right side up">Right side up</strong>

<div id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:"><h4 id="Lens Equation:">Lens Equation:</h4></div>

Some defintions:

<ol>
<li>
Object distance: 

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:-positive"></span><strong id="positive">positive</strong> : If object is on the  left side. 

<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:-Negative"></span><strong id="Negative">Negative</strong>:   For all the reverse. 

</ul>
<li>
Image distance: 

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:-Positive"></span><strong id="Positive">Positive</strong>: Real image.

<li>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:-Negative"></span><strong id="Negative">Negative</strong>: Virtual image.

</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:-Symbols"></span><strong id="Symbols">Symbols</strong> :
xₒ: Object distance -&gt; Negative: Right side. Positive: Left side
xᵢ: Image distance  -&gt; Negative: Virtual Image. Positive: Real image
f : Focal distance  -&gt; Negative: Diverging lens. Positive: Converging lens
Sₒ: Object size     -&gt; Negative: Below the axis. Positive: Above the axis
Sᵢ: Image size      -&gt; Negative: Below the axis. Positive: Above the axis
M : Magnification   -&gt; Negative: Inverted image. Positive: Not inverted image
P : Power of lens.  -&gt; Negative: diverging lens(f negative) Positive: Converging lens(f positive)
</p>

<p>
Note: The lens equation is used for :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Calculating the image location

<li>
Calculating the maginification

</ul>
<p>
<span id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:-Formulae"></span><strong id="Formulae">Formulae</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
1/xₒ + 1/xₒ = 1/f

<li>
M  = Sᵢ/Sₒ = -xᵢ/xₒ

<li>
P = 1/f(in meters)

</ol>

<div id="Lecture 3 : Mirrors and Lenses-Lens Equation:-Lens equation for multiple lenses"><h5 id="Lens equation for multiple lenses">Lens equation for multiple lenses</h5></div>
<p>
The lens equation can also be applied for multiple lenses added one after the other. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
power is added. Eg: Power of lens A is 2 diopters. Power of lens B is -1 diopters. Power of combined lenses is 2 -1 diopters = 1 diopter. Focal length of combined lens is f = 1 meter

<li>
The output(image) of the lens 1, acts as the object for the lens 2

</ul>
<p>
<em>NOTE:  I really wish I see an example for this</em>
