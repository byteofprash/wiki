* Feature Extraction
  - Kernels are used to extract features
  - Thresholding is used to supress "non-feature" parts of the images, as the kernel "doesn't see" them.
* Problems in CV:
	* *Stereo Vision* : From multiple images -> Determine geometry of the scene, by *matching* the corresponding areas. Eg: Using SIFT or something. 
	* *Motion estimation* What if something moved between two frames where we are trying to match
	* *Point spread function* Read more online
	* Cepstrum: Gaussian smoothing?
	*  The motion field: The motion field
