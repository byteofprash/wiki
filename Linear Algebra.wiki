=== Linear spaces ===
V is a linear space if it follows the following rules:
- Commutativity
- Associativity
- There is an element "0" such that a+0 = a 
- There is an "inverse" element -a such that a+ (-a) = 0
- 1*a = a
- λ(μa) = (λμ)a   
- λ(a + b) = λa + λb
- (λ + μ)a = λa + μa

=== Subspace of a linear space ===
*U* is a subspace 
V is a linear space
A non empty set U ⊂ V is called a subspace if:
* x,y ∈ U -> x - y ∈ U
* x ∈ U, λ ∈ R -> λx ∈ U

*Notation: U ≤ V*

=== Generating linear spaces ===
* If there is a set of vectors called (bᵢ) and the linear span of that set of vectors generates the whole linear space V, then the (bᵢ) is called as the generating set.
* *Example* e₁ = [1 0 0] e₂ = [0 1 0] e₃ = [0 0 1]. Then {e₁,e₂,e₃} generates R³. {}{e₁+e₂,e₂+e₃,e₃} also generates R³ because they have all the 3 elements? But however just {e₁, e₂} doesnt generate R³

=== Coordinate system and bases ===
* Linear independence:
A finite set of vectors can be called *linearly independent* if 
λ₁a +.....+ λᵢaᵢ = 0 => λ₁ = λ₂ = ... = λᵢ = 0

=== Basis ===
* A set of vectors in V is called the basis of V if, it's the generating set *and* it is linearly independent. 

Usage: Find online

==== Properties of Basis ====
* every linear space V has a Basis
* Let b₁ , ...bᵢ be the basis of V, then every a ∈ V can be written as a linear combination as 
  *a = Σ λᵢbᵢ*
* Every basis in V has *exactly n* elements in it. 
  This *n* is called as the *dimension* of V
